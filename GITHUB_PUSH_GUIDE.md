# GitHub Push Guide

This guide will help you push your changes to GitHub.

## Your Repository Information

Your repository is already connected to GitHub at:
https://github.com/chrisgelooo/alarmclock.git

## Pushing Your Changes

Follow these steps to push your changes to GitHub:

### 1. Stage Your Changes

Add all the new files to the staging area:

```bash
git add .gitignore LICENSE README.md INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md screenshots/
```

Or to add all changes:

```bash
git add .
```

### 2. Commit Your Changes

Create a commit with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Add documentation, license, and project files"
```

### 3. Push to GitHub

Push your changes to the main branch:

```bash
git push origin main
```

If you're prompted for credentials, enter your GitHub username and password or personal access token.

## Verifying Your Changes

After pushing, visit your GitHub repository to verify that your changes were uploaded:
https://github.com/chrisgelooo/alarmclock

## Adding a Screenshot

1. Take a screenshot of your application
2. Save it as `alarm_clock.png` in the `screenshots` folder
3. Stage, commit, and push the screenshot:

```bash
git add screenshots/alarm_clock.png
git commit -m "Add application screenshot"
git push origin main
```

## Creating a Release

To create a release with your executable:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Releases" on the right side
3. Click "Create a new release"
4. Enter a tag version (e.g., "v1.0.0")
5. Enter a release title (e.g., "Initial Release")
6. Add a description of your release
7. Attach the executable file (you can zip the `dist` folder first)
8. Click "Publish release"

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

If you have trouble authenticating:

1. You may need to use a personal access token instead of your password
2. Create one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
3. Use the token as your password when pushing

### Push Rejected

If your push is rejected:

1. Pull the latest changes first:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. Resolve any conflicts
3. Try pushing again
